Based on the \"Silent Way\" language-teaching method, it will assign each English sound to a distinct colour and reinforce phonetic patterns by using audio clips and interactive games. As learners venture through the app, they will begin to find patterns in the pronunciations and the spellings of different words.\r\n\r\n**List of technologies/languages to build the app:** Objective-C, UIKit, UIKit Dynamics, AudioToolbox, AVFoundation, MediaPlayer\r\n\r\n**Please allow GIF to load (Note that pressing on buttons in the app should play sounds):**\r\n\r\n![demo480](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7607614/5232820/f22430f0-7710-11e4-9c54-bee0367bcdf4.gif)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
